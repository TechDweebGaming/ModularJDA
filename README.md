# ModularJDA
A modular command library designed to improve the development experience of JDA. I'll do a readme later.

# Installation

Add the following to your dependencies section in build.gradle. Make sure to replace version with the latest version, shown above. You'll also need to add jcenter to your repositories section, if it's not already there.
```gradle
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.techdweebgaming:modularjda:version'
  }
```
